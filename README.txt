#Camera PanTilt

This is a simple demonstration of a 2-axis camera pan/tilt using an Arduino-based RUMBA controller.
Communicate to the robot with GCODE, either through the serial window or with an app to deliver a long sequence one line at a time.  
A single rotation on either axis is 48000 steps - that's 0.0075 degrees per step.
If limit switches are installed you can use G92 to find home and get very high accuracy repeatable motion.
